A size large enough that it is statistically unlikely that anyone reading this review will be larger.  I purchased this mattress because my old spring-based unit had finally reached its end of life and I was casting about for a replacement.  When you're a size-enhanced individual, however, maths gets involved.  Your options decrease.<br><br>I rolled the dice on this model of mattress because, at the time of purchase, it was a little over $300 Canadian.  At time of purchase, this is about the price of a bargain spring mattress.  I had serious doubt that this would support me, but was worth the risk.<br><br>The result was beyond my wildest expectations.  The mattress provides amazing support, both for myself and my wife.  I haven't slept this well in 20 years.<br><br>Now, I have no way of knowing how long this mattress will last in this condition.  Continued use will no doubt reduce the firmness and support of the foam.  Just as spring mattresses eventually reach end of life, so too must this foam mattress.  That said, I don't honestly think lifespan should be a serious consideration.  The quality of the item is such that I am confident of getting at least a few years out of it, even at my size.<br><br>More to the point, perhaps, the quality of the sleep is such that, at $300 Canadian for the mattress, I would glad buy a new one every year just to be able to sleep that well each night.  The ability to wake up refreshed like this every morning will pay for itself a thousand fold.  I've gotten more done in the first morning after my first night's sleep on this thing than I accomplished in most of the week prior.  Coming from a broken down spring mattress that had me tossing and turning all night, the difference in quality of sleep really is that stark.

I‚Äôll be completely frank - the mattresses completely exceeded our expectations, seriously. Maybe we were one of the fortunate ones, but there was little to no smell upon opening all 4 mattresses, and they all inflated to correct size and shape within 2 hours. My husband, oldest son and I laid on them, and WoW! Unbelievably comfortable. We are so impressed that we are ordering a King size to replace our older spring mattress set. AND delivery was really fast - two days earlier than expected.

We were sceptical at first reading the reviews here but I can say it has changed the was we sleep. We decided on the 8"" queen because the 12"" was out of stock and we needed a bed asap. it's honestly perfect. Didn't even take 24hrs to fully expand and he can't even feel me rolling out of bed at 4am anymore. It's soft like memory foam yet firm enough to be supportive which was my main concern that it would be poorly made and too soft. But it isn't! It's helped my back immensely and has helped our sleeping which had helped our mental state.

Obviously at that age we didn't want or need to spend fortunes on one, so after a bit of searching around we decided on this zinus one as it seemed well reviewed and also a very reasonable price.<br><br>Mattress arrived promptly as always with amazon, and we opened it the same day after I finished up building his bed. The photo shows mattress just installed approx 15 mins after unwrapping, it has evened out properly after about 48 hours.<br><br>In line with what others have said, there is a fairly strong, unpleasant odour initially. We set the mattress up on the bed and left it for 48 hours to expand fully, and the smell did reduce quite a bit. With bedlinen on there's no noticeable smell.<br><br>Comfort wise I'm honestly surprised how good this mattress is. It's the 8 inch deep one, which is more like 6-7 inches in reality. Seems quite firm, but then you lay on it and it's just... Comfortable feeling. As a 190lb adult, I'd probably go for a deeper one but this one is surprisingly supportive, without being either too firm or too soft.<br><br>Given the price, this was a pleasant surprise üëç also surprised how much movement dampening there is-our little guy was jumping excitedly on his new bed while I laid next to him, and honestly I felt no disturbance at all.<br><br>Overall I'd say really pretty unbeatable value, perfect for kids or guest bed, comfortable enough at a great price. For your everyday adult bed, maybe go for the deeper 10 or 12 inch version for extra comfort.

First off, this mattress is not even close to 8"".  I've had it unpacked for over a week and it's between 5""-7"" depending on which part of the mattress you measure (yes, it's NOT the same height throughout).  Second, the smell from the foam is strong.  I'm not that sensitive to smell but had to sleep on the sofa for a few days because the odor of the mattress was literally keeping me up.  I'd stay away from this (or other Zinus products for that matter...) unless you really don't care and just want something cheap.  I'd like to give a shout out to Amazon for excellent customer service.  I had concerns buying something so large online but I wouldn't hesitate buying large items from Amazon (they make sure you are 100% satisfied).  Hope this review helps, I wasted a lot of time with this purchase and hope I can prevent others from making the same mistake.

That actually worked out well for me because I‚Äôm using this on my daybed. It‚Äôs a snug fit lengthwise and the pressure helps to lift the ends to the same height as the mid-section. It‚Äôs also very comfortable to lie on. I took a fellow reviewer‚Äôs helpful advice of massaging the corners to get them to decompress more evenly. In fact, I massaged the sides and ends regularly over the 72 hours to assist with this process and I think that‚Äôs why my mattress decompressed quite evenly and structured. Great value for the price.

It was sold at a good price, came very quickly, and is VERY comfortable.  You sink into the top layer, but are supported nicely by the layers below.  I'd read complaints that others' didn't plump up properly; but mine was almost the full thickness almost immediately after I unrolled it, and within a couple of hours, it seemed to be full size.  Still, I waited a day, just to be sure, before I used it.  I'm VERY happy with it.<br><br>There is a slight scent to it, which I don't find at all unpleasant, and which seems to be fading.  The only drawback I've noticed is that it does seem to slip a bit on the base I have, so I might buy one of those no-slip sheets to put under it -- but it's not really a problem just to move it back into place.

After removing the bed from the vacuum packaging, it began to expand immediately. As other posters have said, it expanded faster in the middle where it was folded and less compressed. I found that if I tipped it up and flexed it around to agitate it; it accelerated the process and became a little more even. After a day, it was pretty much at advertised thickness. Even if it never reached the full 12"", I was planning to keep it anyway because it was still comfortable and was a respectable price.<br>Other buyers have complained of an odour, but I did not make note of anything after opening it.<br><br>Overall, good price, prompt shipping. Convenient to get it delivered right to your door. Bonus that it is actually comfortable too! I'm happy with this purchase.

It's been in a room with open windows and two fans going, but the intense, toxic smell has not dissipated or lessened at all. I've been sleeping on an air mattress while it airs out, but the smell is giving me really bad headaches and trouble breathing- despite the packaging saying the smell is normal and not toxic. The bed has been really comfortable when I have tried it out, but if the smell continues it will be unusable and not worth my basic health. I wish I could return the bed, but there is no conceivable way for me to mail a giant bed back. I would have gone with a spring mattress or a different memory foam mattress if I would have known the smell would be so strong. I cannot recommend this mattress if you aren't able to leave it in a room of its own with all the windows open for... well, still waiting.... Not sure if others lucked out and I received one that had been sitting in packaging for a long time or what. But the smell is really really strong and not going away so far.

They arrived extremely fast and we unpacked them right away as the package says to do it within 72 hours of arrival.<br><br>Our experience is very similar to other reviewers here: 1. The mattress did arrive with a very strong chemical smell. We found that it was coming from the plastic- so get rid of that right away! We aired out the mattresses, with windows wide open, for 4 days and the smell eventually went away within a week. The only smell left is the green tea extract, which is nice and subtle. My kids don‚Äôt mind it.  2: Our mattresses expanded right away! The first 5 inches as soon as we opened them and the remaining 3 over the course of 3 days- without touching them. I took another reviewers advise by massaging the corners - they came out perfectly squared and even as the rest of the mattress. 3: NOTE: the mattress is wider than a standard twin. At least by half an inch. They‚Äôre meant for platform beds with no edge or lip. We made do with ours because the bunk bed has rails all around. And lastly- these are SO incredibly comfortable! It really does feel like sleeping on a cloud (I know clich√©) but it really does. The memory foam is soft but supports quite well! My kids love it and they have the hardest time leaving the bed in the mornings.

So this time recognizing that the slat system is just bad engineering and that nothing can change that, I opted for a metal frame bed. I have to say, wow, I can't believe I suffered with the other stupidity for so long. I bought this mattress even though it isn't pocket coil but just a memory foam because it had so many reviews vs the other options, and because I could get it the next day.  Now, and this isn't Zinus' fault, the mattress didn't arrive the next day, but rather the day after, but with COVID, it's fine. It arrives in a box and you have to let it inflate. I only let it inflate for a few hours.  I should mention I bought 8 (EIGHT) inch only and it is MORE THAN ENOUGH.  I didn't actually realize how huge the 8 inch would be, I'm glad I didn't buy the 10 or 12 since with a regular bed frame, even the 8 inch one is really high.  The mattress is absolutely fantastic. Considering the price and the convenience, I'm not surprised the coil mattresses are almost gone.  This mattress is, I would say, medium, and I would have maybe liked it a bit firmer, but you only notice that when you are sitting on it or stand on it.  When you lie on it and evenly spread your weight, it's about medium-firm, but gives in a bit, so you feel beautifully hugged without feeling like you're sunk in any way.  I would say for vast majority of people this will be just right.  When you move on it, it doesn't move the rest of the mattress, like the old coil mattresses do. You can have a plate of food next to you and get up and it won't spill.  I was debating whether to get this one or the few top choices that come up when you search, and although I haven't tried those, even though they were cheaper on promo than this one, I opted for this one bec of so many positive reviews and I'm glad I did.<br><br>I'm 6'4, 220lbs, so if I liked it, surely you will too..<br><br>The only negative I would give it is aesthetic - it is white with a pattern on it, it would be nice if there were some colour options, although you don't exactly see it with your bedsheets on it so no biggie.

Missy,www.amazon.ca/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEBT5D5OV4PBSRTYNQVUE2Q3INAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"July 8, 2019",4,A great bed for an amazing price," I bought this bed despite Zinus on Facebook advising me that it's actually medium-soft (Amazon says this bed is medium-firm and that is accurate). I also bought it despite the bad reviews because overall the bed is 4-star and has over 500 reviews. I ordered the 12"" King and it arrived promptly with Prime shipping within the week. I unpacked it the same evening it arrived and within an hour it was already 9"" tall, after two hours it was 10"", and by the following morning it was 11.5""... And that afternoon had fully expanded everywhere to 12"".<br><br>So after 24 hours in a fairly warm room with a fan going and the window open (I recommend letting it expand in a warm room with great air circulation as heat causes the mattress to expand much quicker), I decided to sleep on it. I didn't sleep too well, but that's because it was still off-gassing a bit and I had a muscle strain in my good shoulder from my previous bed that was still healing, and my bad shoulder was as usual, acting up.<br><br>After the second night sleeping on it though, my shoulder pain has diminished greatly in both shoulders and my CHRONIC back pain (from having an injured back) has almost completely dissipated, and as a fibromyalgia sufferer I can say with certainty this bed is helping that as well (I am able to get up in the mornings). I am a bigger woman and fairly tall and this bed provides ample support and comfort despite my size (and there's also plenty of room for my fit hubby when he's not away working). It's also much cooler and dissipates heat much better than my $3000 Stearns and Foster mattress I had prior to this one. It's honestly unbelievable that a mattress that cost me around $500 with taxes and came in a box is better than a $3000 brand name mattress.<br><br>A few expected (as stated in the paper that comes with the bed) cons: The off-gassing is quite intense for the first 2-3 days, after that the smell slowly goes away, but you MUST have good air circulation and preferably a fan going and window open. I had a fan going, the window wide open, AND ran my air purifier in the room for 3 days (and still run it at night). As I have a lovebird, I took precautions and actually sent my lovebird to stay with a family member for at least 10 days to be 100% the off gassing smell is gone and the mattress is no longer expelling ANY sort of scent (just because I can't smell it anymore, doesn't mean it won't affect a respiratory-sensitive bird). My dog and cat however aren't bothered at all by the smell, but again... Keep the room ventilated for at least the first 7-10 days or longer just for the well-being of your pets and yourself. And if you are sensitive to smells/chemicals, maybe this bed isn't for you... Unless you have a week or more to allow this bed to fully air out before sleeping on it.<br><br>Lastly, if you do NOT have a warm, well-ventilated room and do NOT follow the directions, you're gonna end up like the folks leaving one-star reviews on this bed - The bed expands best this way and the smell goes away faster with proper air circulation.

The slipcover seems to tight preventing the mattress from expanding past 4 inches. Total waste of money as clearly no way to return once expanded like this. This thing isn't much more than an over glorified mattress topper. I got my kids 6 Inch duo like this for similar price of this with the sale price and they came in box almost twice the size but at least expanded properly.

It doesn't bunch up when tossing and turning like toppers do. It took about a week for it to decompress to the full 6 inches but I don't mind because I'm using it as a topper. It is firm yet soft enough to make bedtime more comfortable.  My hubby and I have better sleeps because of it. The other bonus is that since I have Amazon prime, this particular mattress gave me the oprion to make monthly payments to pay for it instead of having to pay for it all at once!

I had read so many negative comments about the smell so I really looking out for it, and it was only ever so slight (barely perceptible).  So for me, that was not an issue.<br><br>Second, and my biggest worry, was the mattress not expanding properly.  I did have some issues, but they worked themselves out and the mattress is fine now.  My personal experience was that after waiting a full 72 hours, half the mattress had expanded to about 10 inches, and half had expanded to 6-7 inches.  You could clearly see a 'fold' in the mattress in the middle because of the way it was packed in the box and that was the dividing line between the 10 and the 6-7 inches.  One thing the instructions do say (and encourage) is to sleep on the mattress after 72 hours and that your movement and weight on it will cause the rest of the mattress to expand properly.<br><br>so I put the 10 inches where my pillow was, and put the 6-7 inch side at my feet.  Even not fully expanded I have to say it was massively comfortable.  The sleep was amazing.  It did take about 2 weeks of sleeping on it, but it eventually expanded evenly to 12 inches.  I was seriously thinking I would have to return it (I wanted to avoid this for environmental reasons) but like I said, with a little patience it sorted itself out.<br><br>It is to be noted that I'm a big guy (300+ lbs) and I was worried the mattress wouldn't be firm enough and that I'd sink in.

I bought this along with a Zinus frame, and overall this has been a solid purchase. I would highly recommend it on the merits of cost and quality.

My Review to You,www.amazon.ca/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGRS7PLULU6VC3RPXYEBOCF3XNIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,"December 18, 2019",5,Most Comfortable Bed Available!," I purchased a Queen sized Zinus Mattress and beframe last year when my old bed needed replacing.  I was hesitant about spending over a thousand dollars on a new bed, and didn't relish the thought of still having to move a heavy bed around for cleaning.  When I saw the Zinus bed, I did some research, read the reviews and purchased the mattress, a tall bedframe and head and footboard clips, then followed the instructions when it arrived and set up my new bed.  I was so impressed, that when I decided to replace the mattress on my guest room bed, I once gain chose Zinus.<br><br>The mattresses are very comfortable and give great support with no pressure spots or lumps as with conventional beds.  Also, the foam mattress is covered in a removable, washable cover, and the foam itself is infused with green tea for added freshness and anti-microbial properties. The frames are silent, and don't make any noise at all when turning in bed, even on hardwood floors.  Above all, the quality of them for the money paid is fantastic.  To replace my old queen bed cost me less than a third of a buying a new box spring and mattress bed, and by all indications, it will last just as long, if not longer than my old box spring and mattress.  For updating my guest bedroom, I simply replaced the mattress and used my old box spring and headboard.  If for any reason it needs replacing in the future, I will do that again.  Very highly recommended, especially if moving and needing a new bed.  Why not get one brought directly to you instead?

The cheapest I find is from Ikea but you still have to pay for delivery fee.  I came across this Zinus brand from Amazon and take a chance as it‚Äôs affordable and free delivery. It was delivered fast for such a big item.  You just need to air out the mattress for at least a day to expand and get rid of the packaging smell. The memory foam is firm but comfortable. I just have it for several months so I don‚Äôt know if it will last for several years like the well known branded mattress.

I couldn't care less about memory foam, hybrid or spring. It's all just nonsense to me anyway. I ordered this bed for a couple of reasons and it passed, that's all I care about. If it lasts will be the next test. I wanted gel because supposedly it keeps you cooler. It is no difference from any bed. So if regular foam is hot this is no different from a traditional spring mattress. Who ever thinks this bed is on the softer side might be on too much medication. It is very firm. I like this. It could go slightly less firm but my back is happy that's all that matters. And the price point it's excellent. I spoke with 2 of their reps. One was horrible, didn't understand any of my questions, which were detailed. The other person was adequate. All around with price being a factor very happy. The middle is slightly firmer but maybe because I don't sleep in the middle, so I can't judge properly.

I will admit the expectations were not terribly high,  after all the mattress comes rolled up in a box.  After a 7 day wait,  we recieved our box of mattress and lugged it up to our bedroom.  Which I gotta say is it is much easier to pack a king size mattress up a flight of stairs in a box than it is in full form.  We unboxed and unfolded our mattress and let it sit for 2 days to fully take shape and to gas off. Apparently these style mattresses have a smell from manufacturing when you first unbox them but we never really noticed a smell. (perhaps it being green tea infused helped with that). After a long 2 days of looking at our new mattress from our tired old mattress, we finally got to try it out.  It is amazing! It is the best mattress I've ever slept on. I can't recommend this mattress enough.

Gave it a few love taps and squeezes to make sure it keeps that way. Will be standing on its side for a week or so till I can get out to find some sheets and a frame so it should hit its full, or close to, 12 inches by then. Feels nice and soft, the 3 layers provide a squishy top with increasing firmness from what I can tell from giving it a couple presses by hand.

My partner and I are both around 200 lbs and there is no shifting when someone rolls over, no falling into each other. It was heaven.

We were in the market for something cooling (both hot sleepers) and comfortable and this mattress has been a dream. It was fully raised with air after 24 hours and was instantly amazing to sleep on. It conforms comfortably to the contours of your body and bounces back up quickly. We've been sleeping on it for 3 months now and it's integrity hasn't been compromised whatsoever. A few things I looked for in the reviews at time of purchase were: does it smell when removed from the package? Do the corners puff out properly? How many inches are too much or too little?<br>There was a mild odor when unboxing but it was not overwhelming and reminded me mostly of the plastic it'd been wrapped in than chemical odor from the manufacturer. The mattress conveniently arrived just as we were moving into a new house, so I was able to leave it alone in a bedroom with the window open for a full day before checking on it and the smell from it never raised any flags - I should note, I am also particularly scent-sensitive and was 5 months pregnant at the time so if it'd been overwhelming I would have avoided it.<br>The corners puffed out just as they were meant to. One side raised quicker than the other and this worried me initially but eventually it was completely even. We decided to go for the 8"" as several reviews had indicated that there was no real need for anything more. This couldn't be more true. With baby, I'm about 220lbs, and the lowest my body sinks into the mattress may be 3-4 inches at the most. When I'm laid down, the weight is distributed more evenly and thus causes sinking to be even less, so during sleep there are still several spare inches between you and whatever platform or box spring you have below it. I can rest comfortably on my side or back with no issues and have found that being on my back is even more comfortable with this bed than others because the foam moulds so nicely around you.<br>Something important to note, like any memory foam mattress, one should keep in mind that this is NOT a bed that you can jump into! It doesn't absorb shock AT all.<br>For the price point, Amazon Prime delivery option and overall satisfaction, I would recommend this mattress to ANYONE in the market. An incredible value, especially with Endy/Casper and other competitors offering similar products at 5-10x the price.<br>** to note as well, we also purchased the Zinus bed frame separately and were super impressed with it as well. Very simple and sleek design, extremely straight-forward building instructions and a great little multi-tool that came with. Plus, it came with some super handy little double-sides adhesive strips that cling the mattress to the steel frame to prevent it from slipping around! Amazing!**

(2nd and 3rd pics) By the next day it was full size.<br> I did a LOT of homework and read MANY reviews before buying this as I'm on a limited income and wanted to make a good purchase. I weigh over 300 pounds and had concerns about it supporting my weight. It is firmer than I thought (which is good) and so far the support is very good.<br>There was some odor for a day or two, but given the packaging and what it's made of, that's to be expected. It was gone within a few days.<br>I read some reviews commenting that the corners did not fill in properly, to full height. I suspect this has more to do with the cover restricting it than anything - they are about 1/2 "" less thick, but I don't sleep on the corners so it's all good! I walked all over thee mattress a few times as it was expanding to help it along (especially the corners, which I read was helped by being 'massaged') and I think that helped it fluff up quickly. When I was walking on it, I felt like maybe the mattress was too soft, but once I laid down on it, it was actually firmer than I thought it would be.<br>This mattress is an incredible value and I hope to enjoy many years on it.

No thanks. We did lengthy research before deciding to bite the bullet on this mattress. We‚Äôve now enjoyed it for a couple of months, and I can honestly say it is has been an excellent purchase. I am 9 months pregnant and around 7 months or so, I started experiencing severe back pain that left me walking with a limp for weeks. I can‚Äôt be sure if this mattress is the reason why it went away, but after just 2 nights of sleeping on it, I awoke with zero back pain and have not experienced any since. Could I call it a miracle worker? I‚Äôm hesitant to make such a claim; however, it was the only thing I changed during that tiny time frame. We did allow it to ‚Äúair out‚Äù for several hours on top of our bedframe, but we slept in it that night just fine and no smell has lingered. I highly recommend this product if you‚Äôre searching for a reasonably priced mattress you want delivered right to your door. Shipping was also incredibly fast. I believe we received it within 4 days from our order date.

It was lying on the ground, but we had to prop it up against the wall recently and I have a feeling the smell is coming from the bottom not being able to air out. Hopefully this helps.<br><br>2) The 12"" is really comfy but too thick for a guest mattress. It'll make moving it harder and you'll need extra wide mattress sheets to fit this.<br><br>3) The price of the mattress dropped by $25 less than 12 hours after I purchased it on a 'deal'. Makes me wonder about what's going on with the pricing. I e-mailed Amazon and never heard back from them. I needed the mattress so didn't do more (actual purchase price was about $304)

Buy this!," This is the best purchase I‚Äôve ever made on amazon! I never thought I‚Äôd buy a mattress online, but I figured I would give it a shot for the price. I am SO glad that I did. This bed is like sleeping on a cloud, but at the same time not too soft that you sink in. I used to have issues with hip pain, and it‚Äôs all but disappeared since buying this. I‚Äôm a stomach sleeper, and have had no issues. I also slept on this bed after 24 hours of letting it inflate - not sure if it has inflated to the full 12 inches since I haven‚Äôt measured, but it seriously makes no difference to me. If you‚Äôre thinking about buying this, DO IT!

Glad I ordered this for the kiddos bunk beds and honestly... I‚Äôm a little disappointed I didn‚Äôt look here before purchasing my Endy because the two are very similar.

I always wondered what these memory foam mattresses felt like. Well my old bed was making me wake up sore, really sore and my back was killing me every morning. I ordered this figuring it couldn't be any worse then my old bed if it sucked. Boy was I wrong!! I slept better then I have slept in a long, long time and did not wake up sore at all. Don't get me wrong it took some getting used to. It's hard to explain the way it feels, it's firm but soft at the same time. I really can't believe how refreshed I feel waking up now...other then the not wanting to get out of bed in the morning now lol. My old bed I was up right away because it wasn't comfortable. I still can't believe the price on these!!!

Also, no toxic smells with mine - and this is coming from someone who cannot open her window yet (it is broken). Honestly, I had my boyfriend over the next day and he slept over and it was lovely - motion transfer? I don't know her. I am a side, back and sometimes stomach sleeper (more side though) and this was comfortable. First night it was a little hard, but it gave way a bit as the days went by.

I was interested in the 4 layer foam technology and hoping I'd be lucky enough to get a ""good"" one that inflated all the way and was great. Unfortunately, that did not happen. Like others, mine did not inflate all the way. We unpacked it according to instructions and let it ""do its thing"" for 3 days. The corners and edges never fully inflated. This isn't my first rodeo with memory foam mattresses, as I've bought Lucid, Signature Sleep and Brentwood, all very happy with them. Not this one. The sides are soft and bottom out when you sit on them to put your shoes &amp; socks on. None of my other mattresses did that. Unhappy with this product and will be contacting customer service.

After reading the negative reviews and the positives, I decided to risk it. The package took about a week to show up (Ground and i'm on an island). We took it out around 6pm and within an hour or two it was to it's max size. It came to about 11"" and has been ever since but this has not in the slightest affected it's performance. It is the most comfortable thing I have ever slept on. Please, do you self a favour and take the gamble. It's worth it.

It's been three weeks now and it still smells although not as strong.  I am a lot cooler on this mattress than my regular memory foam, and would recommend it.

I was very pleased with the faint green tea scent. My son finds it very comfortable. It makes him sleep hotter, but he just sleeps without his duvet. I wish I would have ordered the size up, the 12"", if i would have known I'd lose that extra inch. All in all though, we're very pleased with this product and would recommend. I have definitely been converted to the foam mattress over the old school spring.
